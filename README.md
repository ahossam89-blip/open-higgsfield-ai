# Open Higgsfield AI — Open-Source Alternative to Higgsfield AI

> **The free, open-source alternative to Higgsfield AI.** Generate AI images and cinematic shots using 20+ state-of-the-art models — without the closed ecosystem or subscription fees.

Open Higgsfield AI is an open-source AI image and cinema studio that brings Higgsfield-style creative workflows to everyone. Powered by [Muapi.ai](https://muapi.ai), it supports models like Flux Schnell, Flux Dev, SDXL, Ideogram, Midjourney, and more — all from a sleek, modern interface you can self-host and customize.

**Why Open Higgsfield AI instead of Higgsfield AI?**
- **Free & open-source** — no subscription, no vendor lock-in
- **Self-hosted** — your data stays on your machine
- **20+ models** — access more AI models than any single closed platform
- **Extensible** — add your own models, modify the UI, build on top of it

For a deep dive into the technical architecture and the philosophy behind the "Infinite Budget" cinema workflow, see our [comprehensive guide and roadmap](https://medium.com/@anilmatcha/building-open-higgsfield-ai-an-open-source-ai-cinema-studio-83c1e0a2a5f1).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- A [Muapi.ai](https://muapi.ai) API key

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Anil-matcha/Open-Higgsfield-AI.git
cd Open-Higgsfield-AI

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. You'll be prompted to enter your Muapi API key on first use.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## 🔌 API Integration

The app communicates with [Muapi.ai](https://muapi.ai) using a two-step pattern:

1. **Submit** — `POST /api/v1/{model-endpoint}` with prompt and parameters
2. **Poll** — `GET /api/v1/predictions/{request_id}/result` until status is `completed`

Authentication uses the `x-api-key` header. During development, a Vite proxy handles CORS by routing `/api` requests to `https://api.muapi.ai`.

## 🎨 Supported Models

| Model | Endpoint | Resolution Options |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| Nano Banana | `nano-banana` | — |
| Nano Banana Pro | `nano-banana-pro` | **up to 4K** (Cinema Studio) |
| Flux Schnell | `flux-schnell-image` | — |
| Flux Dev | `flux-dev-image` | — |
| Flux Dev LoRA | `flux-dev-lora` | — |
| Ideogram V2 | `ideogram-v2` | — |
| SDXL | `sdxl` | — |
| And 15+ more... | | |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Vite** — Build tool & dev server
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — Utility-first styling
- **Vanilla JS** — No framework, pure DOM manipulation
- **Muapi.ai** — AI model API gateway

## 🤔 How is this different from Higgsfield AI?

Higgsfield AI is a proprietary AI video and image generation platform. **Open Higgsfield AI** is a community-driven, open-source alternative that provides similar creative capabilities without the closed ecosystem:

| | Higgsfield AI | Open Higgsfield AI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | Subscription-based | Free (open-source) |
| **Models** | Proprietary | 20+ open & commercial models |
| **Self-hosting** | No | Yes |
| **Customizable** | No | Fully hackable |
| **Data privacy** | Cloud-based | Your data stays local |
| **Source code** | Closed | MIT licensed |

## 📚 Arabic KDP Publishing Factory

This repository also hosts an unrelated automated pipeline for producing
Arabic-language Amazon KDP books — public-domain classics with original
Claude-generated introductions/annotations, facing-page Arabic/English
bilingual editions with Claude-generated translations, and low-content
planners/handwriting workbooks — each in paperback, hardcover, and/or
EPUB3 ebook format, with series-branded covers. A weekly GitHub Action runs
a book through generation, an automated QA gate (structural checks plus a
Claude **vision** pass on rasterized pages — a failure quarantines the book
and it's never packaged), and packaging, then attaches the result to a
draft GitHub Release; a monthly Action emails a queue-health digest. See
[`BOOK_FACTORY.md`](BOOK_FACTORY.md) for the full documentation, including
a one-time setup checklist and a KDP upload walkthrough.
